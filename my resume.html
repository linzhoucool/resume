Software Developer/Engineer,2018-08-09

Dear Tom crus

Your willingness to take time out of your busy day on 08 7th to meet with me is greatly appreciated. I really enjoyed speaking with you about the Embedded Software Developer/Engineer position.

As mentioned during our discussion, I have a strong background in 3 years of Game Company.  After meeting with you and learning about Ubisoft's future projects, I am confident that my cooperation and huge computer language will be a great help to your team. Being able to work on this position, I can provide diploma of computer science and 3 years working experiences for your company.

Again, I appreciate your time and consideration for this exciting opportunity. Please let me know if I can provide you with any further information about my background or qualifications. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
